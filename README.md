# Google-courses-crash course on python-word cloud
# # Final Project - Word Cloud

For this project, you'll create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.  
A dictionary is the output of the `calculate_frequencies` function. The `wordcloud` module will then generate the image from your dictionary. For the input text of your script, you will need to provide a file that  contains text only.  For the text itself, you can copy and paste the contents of a website you like Or you can use a site like [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) to find books that are available online.  You could see what word clouds you can get from famous books, like a Shakespeare play or a novel by Jane Austen. Save this as a .txt file somewhere on your computer.
